## About Me
Hi! I'm Grace Brazil, a graduate student in Computer Science (MSCS) at Georgia Institute of Technology, focusing on Machine Learning and expected graduation December 2025.  Welcome to my website dedicated to my DREAM Summer Research Project! ðŸ‘‹

Upon completing my BS in Electrical Engineering (BSEE) at the University of Central Florida, I started on my career in the tech industry. I joined Qualcomm as an Engineer and quickly progressed to a Senior Engineer role within 4 years. My role at Qualcomm was on software integration and testing team within the 5G modem system testing world. This background, combined with my passion for AI/ML, fuels my desire to develop practical and trustworthy solutions that enhance collaboration between humans and AI.
