## About Me
Hi! I'm Grace Brazil, a Master's student in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology, focusing on Machine Learning (expected graduation December 2025).  Welcome to my website dedicated to my DREAM Summer Research Project! ðŸ‘‹

Prior to pursuing my graduate studies, I was a Senior Engineer at Qualcomm with ~4 years of experience in software integration and testing. This background, combined with my passion for AI/ML, fuels my desire to develop practical and trustworthy solutions that enhance collaboration between humans and AI.
