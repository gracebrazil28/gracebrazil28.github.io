## About Me
Hi! I'm Grace Brazil, a graduate student in Computer Science (MSCS) at Georgia Institute of Technology, focusing on Machine Learning and expected graduation December 2025.  Welcome to my website dedicated to my DREAM Summer Research Project! ðŸ‘‹

Upon completing my BS in Electrical Engineering (BSEE) at the University of Central Florida, I started on my career in the tech industry. I joined Qualcomm as an Engineer and quickly progressed to a Senior Engineer role within 4 years. My role focused on software integration and testing within the 5G modem system testing team. While working full-time, I started my graduate studies part-time, transitioning to full-time student and graduate research assistant a year later.

My interest in Knowledge-Based AI, a graduate-level CS course, was particularly piqued by its focus on the intersection between human cognition and AI models. This exposure sparked my interest in modeling human cognition and its interaction in building context-aware AI models. I believe there's immense potential for humans and computers to not only interact but learn and collaborate effectively through AI models that integrate with human cognitive models. This background, coupled with my passion for AI/ML, fuels my desire to develop practical solutions that bridge the gap and enhance human-AI collaboration.

## About My Advisor

[Dr. Ashok K. Goel](https://dilab.gatech.edu/ashok-k-goel/) is a Professor of Computer Science and Human-Centered Computing in the School of [Interactive Computing](https://www.ic.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Institute of Technology and the Chief Scientist with Georgia Techâ€™s [Center for 21st Century Universities](https://c21u.gatech.edu/). He is also the Executive Director of NSFâ€™s [National AI Institute for Adult Learning and Online Education](https://aialoe.org/).
Ashok conducted his Ph.D. research in Computer and Information Science at The Ohio State University under the supervision of Professor (Emeritus) Balakrishnan Chandrasekaran. His dissertation was titled ***Integrating Case-Based and Model-Based Reasoning for Adaptive Design Problem Solving***. He joined the Georgia Tech faculty in 1989 immediately after receiving his Ph.D. At Georgia Tech, he directs the [Design Intelligence Laboratory](https://dilab.gatech.edu/) that presently consists of several faculty, research scientists, and about twenty graduate and undergraduate students.

Dr. Goel's research focuses on cognitive systems at the intersection of artificial intelligence and cognitive science, with an emphasis on computational design and creativity inspired by nature. Notably, his work on biologically inspired design won a Best Paper Award at the ACM Conference on Creativity and Cognition. He has contributed significantly to online education, developing virtual teaching assistants like Jill Watson, and has co-edited several influential books. Ashok has received multiple accolades, including the AAAI Outstanding AI Educator Award, and currently leads the National AI Institute for Adult Learning and Online Education.

## About My Project

My research project aims to enhance the effectiveness of autonomous coaching agents in educational settings by integrating Generative AI with a deep understanding of learning theory. This research focuses on how active learning and cognitive engagement impact skill acquisition and explores methods of explanation generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the relevance and quality of explanations provided by these systems.

The methodology involves developing a Task-Model-Knowledge (TMK) cognitive model designed to represent and evaluate the skills learners need to acquire. This includes testing the TMK model against human-centric evaluation metrics central to explainable AI to assess its effectiveness. Additionally, the project will explore the potential of generative AI and analyze the use of multi-agent reasoners with LLMs. Through these approaches, the research aims to bridge the gap between traditional educational methods and AI-driven solutions, significantly enhancing the learning experience by providing more accurate, contextually relevant, and insightful feedback to students.
