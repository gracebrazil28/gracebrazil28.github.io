## About Me
Hi! I'm Grace Brazil, a graduate student in Computer Science (MSCS) at Georgia Institute of Technology, focusing on Machine Learning and expected graduation December 2025.  Welcome to my website dedicated to my DREAM Summer Research Project! ðŸ‘‹

Upon completing my BS in Electrical Engineering (BSEE) at the University of Central Florida, I started on my career in the tech industry. I joined Qualcomm as an Engineer and quickly progressed to a Senior Engineer role within 4 years. My role focused on software integration and testing within the 5G modem system testing team. While working full-time, I started my graduate studies part-time, transitioning to full-time student and graduate research assistant a year later.

My interest in Knowledge-Based AI, a graduate-level CS course, was particularly piqued by its focus on the intersection between human cognition and AI models. This exposure sparked my interest in modeling human cognition and its interaction in building context-aware AI models. I believe there's immense potential for humans and computers to not only interact but learn and collaborate effectively through AI models that integrate with human cognitive models. This background, coupled with my passion for AI/ML, fuels my desire to develop practical solutions that bridge the gap and enhance human-AI collaboration.
